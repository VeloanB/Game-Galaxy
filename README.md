# __GAME GALAXY__

Game galaxy is a program where you can play games. Currently there are three games on the platform which are Battleship, Ultimate TicTacToe and Wordle.

## __HOME SCREEN__

This is the center of the galaxy where you can select any of the three games with the corresponding buttons on the screen.

## __BATTLESHIP__

At any point you can return to the home screen by pressing the home button in the top left corner. 

### Initial Screen
This version of battleship is played between a player and the computer with ranging difficulties. When you enter battleship, you can press the button "Play". Once clicked you can choose a difficulty which include: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert and Impossible. ***NOTE: The computer only cheats in Impossible mode and the rest of the difficulties are genuine.***

### Game Screen
Once a difficulty is selected, the game will start. The 10 by 10 grid on top is where you shoot. A red 'X' means a hit and a white 'X' means miss. You can fire by clicking on an empty square on the 10 by 10 grid.

Every time the player fires, the computer will fire at your ships. Your ships are visible on your 10 by 10 grid at the bottom. The same rules for coloured 'x' applies.

To the right of both grids is where the shot info will be relayed to you. It will display the coordinates of both the player and computers shots. Additionally, it will tell you if the shot is a hit or a miss. If you have sunk a ship it will tell you the name of the ship you have sunk.

Below your player shot information, are visuals of what size ships are remaining. When a ship has been sunk the visual will turn completely red, if it is gray the ship is still floating. The size of ships is as follows: 

1. Destroyer - 2
2. Cruiser - 3
3. Submarine - 3
4. Battleship - 4
5. Carrier - 5

The first player / computer to sink all 5 of the opponents ships wins.

### End Screen

Once the game is over, you will be sent to a screen that tells you who won, the difficulty of the bot and how many shots it took. You will see three buttons on your screen. The play again button will allow you to play again. The home button will bring you back to the home screen and the back button will allow you to hide the end screen to see the board. If you lost to the computer, pressing the back button will allow you to see the computer ship locations highlighted in yellow.

## Wordle 

At any point you can return to the home screen by pressing the home button in the top left corner.

### Game Screen
Wordle is a guessing game where you try to guess the random 5 letter word in 6 or less guesses. 

When you first load into the game, the 5x6 grid is the game grid and below that is a visual keyboard that helps with seeing the colours visually.

Every single time you type a letter it will fill the last availible square in the row. Press backspace to delete the last letter. Once the row is full with a word you can press enter to submit that guess. You will get a visual response and all the boxes in that row will be coloured. If the letter you guessed exists in the answer and is at the right spot, the letter will be green. If the letter you guessed exists in the word in a different spot, the letter will be yellow. If the letter you guessed doesn't exist in the word, the letter will be gray. 

The goal is to use the information given based on previous guesses to guess the final word.

### End Screen

Once the player guesses the word correctly or uses all 6 guesses they will be brought to the end screen. If they guessed the word correctly, they will get a congratulations message. If they did not get the word, the program will tell them the word.

You will see three buttons on your screen. The play again button will allow you to play again. The home button will bring you back to the home screen and the back button will allow you to hide the end screen to see the game screen and all previous guesses/responses.

## Ultimate Tic Tac Toe

Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is a more advanced version of tic tac toe. Currently it is a 2 player game. Instead of the usual 9 squares there are 9 big squares with 9 smaller squares inside them. If you win a small square it becomes a big letter and to win the game you have to get 3 big letters in a row to win. If the small square is a draw it counts for no one. The twist is that whichever smaller square you select corresponds to the big square your opponent is forced to play in their next turn. If the big square has been won or drawn, the player can go anywhere they please.

At any point you can return to the home screen by pressing the home button in the top left corner.

### Game Screen

When you load into the game you will see some text at the top which indicates whose turn it is. The game grid is in the center of the screen. The grid has clearly been separated. To play your turn click which ever green square you would like to take and then pass the turn to your opponent.

### End Screen

Once the game has been won or drawn, you will be brought to an end screen which will tell you who won / if it was a draw. 

You will see three buttons on your screen. The play again button will allow you to play again. The home button will bring you back to the home screen and the back button will allow you to hide the end screen to see the game screen and see the whole game.
